## Chatbot configuration.
## The fields here are loaded by the application at startup if
## desired.  For simplicity the current implementation embeds all
## behaviour in code, but future iterations could read these values
## and adjust accordingly.

# bot_name is the friendly name the chatbot uses when introducing
# itself.  Changing this value will update the greeting message.
bot_name = "FriendlyBot"

# max_topics defines how many things the bot will remember when the
# user tells it about their interests using phrases like "i like ...".
# Once this limit is reached new topics will not be stored.
